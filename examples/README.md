# Example Scenarios

The following subdirectories contain example scenarios of root Terraform configurations that call the module in various ways. Each example contains a `terraform.tfvars.example` file with dummy values. You should populate your own custom values in place of the dummy values, and then remove the `.example` file extension such that it becomes your own `terraform.tfvars` file and that is ready for deployment.
